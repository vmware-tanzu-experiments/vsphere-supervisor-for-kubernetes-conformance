# Contributing

## Project Scope

This is a project intended as a place to publicly communicate our vSphere Supervisor Conformance
status with respect to containers deployed to hardware-isolated "vSphere Pods".
We intend to achieve this by publishing useful guides to conformance considerations of using
vSphere Pods and the raw results themselves.

## How to Contribute

Since this project is a means of publishing data from VMware, there is no assumed means of
contributing to the project. However, if you would like to interact with us on this topic,
request addition information or have anything you would like to see, we would
very much encourage you to raise issues on the project.
